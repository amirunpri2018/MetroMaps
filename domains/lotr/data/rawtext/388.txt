two Orcs up: their  voices were growing  nearer again. Now they seemed quite
close.
`That's what I'm going  to do,'  said Shagrat in angry tones.  'Put him
right up in the top chamber.'
`What for? ' growled Gorbag. `Haven't you any lock-ups down below? '
`He's  going out of harm's way,  I  tell  you,' answered Shagrat. 'See?
He's  precious.  I  don't trust  all  my lads,  and  none of yours;  nor you
neither, when you're mad for fun. He's going where I want him, and where you
won't come,  if you  don't keep civil. Up to the top,  I  say. He'll be safe
there.'
`Will  he?'  said Sam. 'You're  forgetting the great big elvish warrior
that's loose!' And with that he raced  round  the last corner, only to  find
that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the Ring gave him,
he had misjudged the distance.
The two orc-figures were still some way ahead. He could  see  them now,
black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an
incline;  and  at  the  end, wide open,  were  great  double doors,  leading
probably to deep  chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the
Orcs  with their burden  had  passed inside. Gorbag and Shagrat were drawing
near the gate.
Sam  heard a burst  of hoarse singing, blaring of horns  and banging of
gongs, a hideous clamour. Gorbag and Shagrat were already on the threshold.
Sam yelled  and brandished Sting, but his little  voice was  drowned in
the tumult. No one heeded him.
The  great  doors slammed to. Boom.  The bars  of iron fell  into place
inside. Clang.  The gate was  shut.  Sam  hurled  himself against the bolted
brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He  was out in the darkness.
Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy.
Here ends the second part of the history of the War of the Ring.
The third  part tells of  the  last defence against the Shadow, and the

end of the mission of the Ring-bearer in            THE RETURN OF THE KING
